# Computer-Graphics

This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating various aspects of computer graphics using OpenGL. Each project focuses on different techniques and concepts in the field of computer graphics.

## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Barnsley's Fractal Fern](https://github.com/KrantiWalke/Computer-Graphics/tree/main/Project%20%231%20%3A%20Barnsley%E2%80%99s%20Fractal%20Fern)
- An OpenGL application to generate and display Barnsley's Fractal Fern.

### [Project 2: Sphere Move](https://github.com/KrantiWalke/Computer-Graphics/tree/main/Project%20%202%3A%20Sphere%20Move)
- Interactive application to visualize moving spheres within a 3D space.

### [Project 3: Skybox and Textured Sphere](https://github.com/KrantiWalke/Computer-Graphics/tree/main/Project%203%20%3A%20%20SkyBox%20Design)
- Demonstrates a 3D scene with a skybox and a textured sphere.

### [Project 4: Bezier Curve](https://github.com/KrantiWalke/Computer-Graphics/tree/main/Project%204%20%3A%20Bezier%20Curve)
- Interactive application to create and visualize a Bezier curve in 3D.

### [Project 5: Bezier Curve 2D Animation](https://github.com/KrantiWalke/Computer-Graphics/tree/main/Project%205%3A%20-%20Bezier%20Curve%202D%20Animation)
- Implements a 2D animation of a sprite along a Bezier curve with a parallax background.

### [Project 6: Shaders](https://github.com/KrantiWalke/Computer-Graphics/tree/main/Project%206%3A%20Shaders)
- Demonstrates the use of shaders in OpenGL to render a textured teapot with interactive features.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

- OpenGL
- GLUT library
- GLEW library (For Project 6)
- SOIL library (For texture loading in relevant projects)

### Compilation and Running

Each project folder contains specific instructions for compilation and execution. Please refer to the individual `README.md` files within each project directory for detailed steps.
